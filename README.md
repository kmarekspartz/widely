## Static Site as a Service using AWS S3

Widely makes deploying static websites easy!

### Usage

~~~~
mkdir www.hello-world.com
echo 'Hello world!' > www.hello-world.com/index.html
cd www.hello-world.com
widely sites:create www.hello-world.com
widely open
~~~~


### Installation

~~~~
pip install widely
~~~~

If your `pip` is `pip-3`:

~~~~
pip-2.7 install widely
~~~~

`widely` was developed on Python 2.7.5 on Mac OS X, but it should work
on any system with Python 2.7.

Compatibility with Python 3 and 2.6 is planned.


### Heroku toolbelt-style command line tool

- Built using `docopt`, `prettytable`, `boto`, `feedparser`


### Issues

- Python 3 and 2.6 compatibility
- Use S3's logging
- Support multipart etags (or add in our own metadata)
- Don't use MD5
- Better globs
- Port not being released quickly in `widely local`
- Serving compressed files from S3
- Use Amazon CloudFront and Route 53
- Tests!
